# Politicize
 
##A puzzle game to challenge the mind while confronting the dangers of political gerrymandering.

###You work for a cat named Regry. He's the president of the Death Party, a political organization that fights for a society with no laws - anarchy. To gain power, he's enlisted you -- the nation's top political scientist -- to gerrymander political maps in his favor.

###You'll have to move voter blocs around the grid with a limited number of moves such that it benefits the Death Party. Watch out, though, some voter blocs act differently than others!
