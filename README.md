# Politicize
 
## A Puzzle Game to Navigate Political Gerrymandering.

### You work for a corrupt politician named Regry. He's the president of the Death Party, a political organization that wants a society with no laws. To help candidates he supports gain power, he's enlisted you -- the nation's top political scientist -- to finagle the outcomes of elections by gerrymandering: changing the boundaries of voting districts to win more seats in his favor. He wants you to employ dirty tactics to cheat democracy.

### [Gerrymandering](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/fairvote/pages/6634/meta_images/original/How_to_Steal_an_Election_-_Gerrymandering.svg.png?1505232361) is when a political party changes voter districts to win more seats. It is antidemocratic.

## Regry Darmen, The Death Party's President, Guides You Throughout the Game.
